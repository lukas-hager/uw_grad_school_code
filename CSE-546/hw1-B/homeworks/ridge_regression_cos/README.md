## Ridge Regression with cosine transformation
In this problem you will improve on implementation of the multi-class classifier using ridge regression.
There are 3 functions you will have to implement. Start with `transform_data` and `split_into_validation`.
Once you have finished these functions, implement `main` function.
It will build on top of `transform_data` and `split_into_validation` [`ridge_regression_cos.py`](./ridge_regression_cos.py).

After finishing problems you will run the code.
First you will **need to copy finished problem `ridge_regression_mnist`** from hw1-A to `homeworks` directory. Then **from the root directory of `.zip`** (`python homeworks/ridge_regression_cos/ridge_regression_cos.py`) and in `.pdf` submit train, validation and testing errors (along with confidence interval in case testing) that got printed out.
