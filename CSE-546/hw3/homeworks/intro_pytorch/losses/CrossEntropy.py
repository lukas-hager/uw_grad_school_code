        For a single example (x is vector of predictions, y is correct class):

        cross_entropy(x, y) = -log(x[y])

        Args:
            y_pred (torch.Tensor): More specifically a torch.FloatTensor, with shape (n, c).
                Predictions of classes. Each row is normalized so that L-1 norm is 1 (Each row is proper probability vector).
                Input data.
            y_true (torch.Tensor): More specifically a torch.LongTensor, with shape (n,).
                Each element is an integer in range [0, c).
                Input data.

        Returns:
            torch.Tensor: More specifically a SINGLE VALUE torch.FloatTensor (i.e. with shape (1,)).
                Should be a mean over all examples.
                Result.

        Note:
            - YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED to use torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss / torch.nn.NLLLoss (or their functional counterparts) in this class
            - Make use of pytorch documentation: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html
            - Not that this is different from torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss, as it doesn't perform softmax, but anticipates the result to already be normalized.
