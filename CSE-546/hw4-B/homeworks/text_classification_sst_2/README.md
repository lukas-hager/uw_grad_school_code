## Text Classification on SST-2
In this problem you will implement different types of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and use them to classify sentiment of sequences.
You should follow the pdf in order of implementing functions (all of them can be found in [problems.py](./problems.py) file):

* `collate_fn`
* all functions in `RNNBinaryClassificationModel`
* `get_parameters`

After finishing assignment run the code (for example `python homeworks/text_classification_sst_2/train.py`) and in `.pdf` submit train and validation errors of best epoch for each model.
